## About

This is the source repository for my microblog - a space for:

- 💭 **Quick reflections** on software engineering, distributed systems, and product development
- 🔧 **Code snippets** and technical discoveries
- 🚀 **Show your work** - progress updates on GardenOS and Hayeshi projects
- 🥋 **Cross-disciplinary insights** from teaching Taekwondo and building software
- 📚 **Curated learning** - interesting articles with commentary

Less polished than [yeinerf.com](https://yeinerf.com), more frequent, more experimental.

## Philosophy

- **Publish early, iterate often** - Don't wait for the "perfect" post
- **Learning in public** - Share what I'm discovering, even if incomplete
- **Genuine value over AI hype** - Pragmatic takes on what works vs. what's trendy
- **Cross-pollination** - Connections between code, teaching, entrepreneurship, and life

---

## Topics

- Distributed systems (consensus, replication, sharding)
- Product development (0→1, build vs. buy, AI integration)
